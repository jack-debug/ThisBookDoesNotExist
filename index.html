<p style="font-size=20px;">This Book Does Not Exist is a project using Generative Adversial Networks to generate images of book covers.</p>
<br>
  <h3>Generative Adversial Network</h3>
  <p style="font-size=20px;">A Generative Adversial Network or GAN for short is a type of AI that uses unsupervised learning to generate images.<br>Essentially, a GAN has two different AI both trying to outsmart the other, the generator and the discriminator.<br>The generator looks at input images, which in this case were book covers, and tries to create similar images.<br>The discriminator looks at these images and makes an assessment as to whether the images the generator made are real or fake.<br>If the discriminator classifies it as fake, the generator leanrs and tries again, making better results each time it tries.<br>Eventually, it gets to a point where the geenrator creates an image the discriminator classifies as real and that's when the training stops.</p>
