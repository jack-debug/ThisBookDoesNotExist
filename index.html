This Book Does Not Exist is a project using Generative Adversial Networks to generate images of book covers.
<br>
  <h4>Generative Adversial Network</h4>
  <p>A Generative Adversial Network or GAN for short is a type of AI that uses unsupervised learning to generate images.<br>
  Essentially, a GAN has two different AI both trying to outsmart the other, the generator and the discriminator.<br>
  The generator looks at input images, which in this case were book covers, and tries to create similar images.<br>
  The discriminator looks at these images and makes an assessment as to whether the images the generator made are real or fake.<br>
  If it's fake, the generator leanrs and tries again, making better results each time it tries.<br>
  Eventually, it gets to a point where the geenrator creates an image the discriminator classifies as real and that's when the training stops.</p>
