<!--put training gif here-->
<p>This Book Does Not Exist is a project using Generative Adversial Networks to generate images of book covers.</p>
  <h3>Generative Adversial Network</h3>
  <p>A Generative Adversial Network or GAN for short is a type of AI that uses unsupervised learning to generate images.<br>Essentially, a GAN has two different AI both trying to outsmart the other, the generator and the discriminator.<br>The generator looks at input images, which in this case were book covers, and tries to create similar images.<br>The discriminator looks at these images and makes an assessment as to whether the images the generator made are real or fake.<br>If the discriminator classifies it as fake, the generator leanrs and tries again, making better results each time it tries.<br>Eventually, it gets to a point where the geenrator creates an image the discriminator classifies as real and that's when the training stops.</p>

  <p>The GAN I used for this project was <a href="https://github.com/HyperGAN/HyperGAN">HyperGAN</a> and I am currently working on a StyleGAN version.<br></p>
  <h3>Examples</h3>
  Work-in-progress.
